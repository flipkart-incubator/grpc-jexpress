/**
 * Abstract base class for HTTP filters that process requests and responses around HTTP method invocations.
 * This class provides a framework for capturing and manipulating HTTP request and response objects,
 * including headers and other metadata. It extends the generic {@link Filter} interface to work specifically
 * with HTTP requests and responses.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class should provide specific processing logic by overriding the
 * {@link #doProcessRequest(ServletRequest, RequestParams)} and {@link #doProcessResponse(ServletResponse)}
 * methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <ServletRequest>  The ServletRequest object that contains the client's request
 * @param <ServletResponse> The ServletResponse object that contains the filter's response
 * @param <Set<String>>     The type of metadata associated with the request, typically a set of header names
